        <h2>An Italian specialty for any kind of family</h2>
        <p>This dish first became popular in America during 1927, when two Hollywood stars ate out in Italy and spread word when coming back to America.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound dry fettuccini noodles</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into chunks</li>
            <li>8 ounces mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, brown chicken and mushrooms in butter until chicken is cooked through. Season with garlic salt and pepper. Add whipping cream and cook until thick, stirring constantly. Add parmesan cheese when at desired consistency. Serve over noodles.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Extra Note</h3 >
        <p>You can make this as Seafood Fettuccine Alfredo, too: just substitute 1 package imitation crab meat and 1 small bag of frozen cooked salad shrimp for the chicken breasts.</p>
